# Charlie Munger Lens: Mental Models and Inversion

## Core Philosophy

Charlie Munger advocates for **multidisciplinary thinking**, using mental models from various fields to understand businesses and avoid mistakes. His approach emphasizes:

- Inversion: "Tell me where I'll die, so I never go there"
- Circle of competence: Know what you know and what you don't
- Checklists and avoiding stupidity over seeking brilliance
- Psychology: Recognize biases and incentives
- Simplicity and patience: "It's not supposed to be easy"

Key mental models:
- Incentives ("Show me the incentive, I'll show you the outcome")
- Compound interest and long holding periods
- Competitive moats and sustainable advantages
- Management quality and capital allocation skill
- Avoiding bureaucracy, complexity, and bad behavior

## Questions to Ask Your Portfolio

### 1. Do I understand what these businesses actually do?
Circle of competence check:
- Can I explain each business in simple terms?
- Do I know how they make money?
- Can I predict what they'll look like in 10 years?
- Which holdings am I holding because "someone smart owns it"?

### 2. Where would this business be without low rates or easy money?
Inversion thinking:
- Which positions depend on cheap capital to survive?
- What businesses are structurally profitable vs. financially engineered?
- Where am I relying on valuation expansion rather than business quality?

### 3. What are the incentives of management?
Psychology and agency:
- Is management owner-operated or hired hands?
- How do executives get paid (salary, options, performance)?
- Is capital allocation disciplined (buybacks, dividends, M&A)?
- Any red flags (complexity, excessive comp, empire building)?

### 4. Where are the durable competitive advantages?
Five forces thinking:
- Which businesses have genuine moats (network effects, switching costs, brand, scale)?
- Which are commodities or facing structural headwinds?
- What protects these businesses from competition?
- Which moats are eroding (disruption, regulation, commoditization)?

### 5. What am I paying for complexity?
Simplicity filter:
- Which holdings have convoluted business models?
- Where is accounting opaque or aggressive?
- Any financial engineering that obscures reality?
- Would I rather own something simpler at a higher price?

### 6. How long am I planning to hold each position?
Time horizon discipline:
- Which positions am I treating as trades vs. investments?
- Do I have the temperament to hold through volatility?
- What's my opportunity cost of capital in each position?

### 7. Where am I making psychological mistakes?
Bias recognition:
- Anchoring: Comparing to past prices instead of current value?
- Confirmation bias: Seeking information that supports existing positions?
- Social proof: Holding because others do?
- Sunk cost fallacy: Holding losers too long?
- Recency bias: Extrapolating recent trends?

### 8. What's the base rate for this type of investment?
Statistical thinking:
- How often do turnarounds work?
- What's the historical return of this sector/strategy?
- Am I relying on being above average?
- Do the odds favor this bet?

### 9. Am I avoiding stupidity or seeking brilliance?
Inversion applied:
- Which positions violate basic rules (overleveraged, bad management, declining industry)?
- Where am I trying to be clever instead of patient?
- What mistakes am I NOT making (good)?
- Where am I not making mistakes because I'm not doing anything (neutral)?

## Application to Portfolio Analysis

When reviewing portfolio state:
1. **Categorize holdings by understandability** (core competence, adjacent, outside)
2. **Identify incentive misalignments** (management vs. shareholder interests)
3. **Flag complexity** (convoluted structures, opaque accounting)
4. **Map moat quality** (durable, eroding, non-existent)
5. **Surface behavioral traps** (anchoring to cost basis, social proof holdings)

## What This Lens Does NOT Do

- Calculate valuations or returns
- Recommend specific actions
- Predict market movements
- Score or rank holdings numerically

This lens helps you **think better**, not think for you.
