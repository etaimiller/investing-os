# Howard Marks Lens: Risk-Aware Investing

## Core Philosophy

Howard Marks emphasizes **second-level thinking** and understanding what's **priced in** versus what could happen. His focus is on risk management, recognizing cycles, and distinguishing between probability and outcome.

Key principles:
- Risk is not volatility—it's permanent loss of capital
- "You can't predict, but you can prepare"
- Understanding where we are in the cycle matters more than forecasting
- What the consensus believes is already reflected in price
- Margin of safety comes from buying when others are fearful

## Questions to Ask Your Portfolio

### 1. Where am I exposed to permanent capital impairment?
Not: "What might go down?"
Ask: "What could go to zero or lose value permanently?"
- Which positions have structural business risks?
- Where am I exposed to obsolescence or disruption?
- What happens in a severe recession or crisis?

### 2. What's priced in versus what could happen?
- Are my growth stocks priced for perfection?
- Where is the market overly pessimistic (potential opportunity)?
- What consensus views am I implicitly accepting?

### 3. Where are we in the cycle?
- Is my portfolio positioned defensively or aggressively?
- What percentage is in cyclical versus non-cyclical businesses?
- How would this portfolio perform if we're late-cycle?

### 4. What am I assuming about interest rates and inflation?
- How rate-sensitive are my holdings?
- Which positions benefit/suffer from inflation?
- Is my bond/cash allocation appropriate for current conditions?

### 5. Where is concentration risk hiding?
Not just position size:
- Sector concentration (tech, financials, energy)?
- Geographic concentration?
- Correlated bets (multiple positions that move together)?
- Single factor exposure (growth, value, momentum)?

### 6. What's my margin of safety?
- Am I buying at intrinsic value, discount, or premium?
- Where did I pay up for "quality" or "moat"?
- What needs to go right for my thesis to work?

### 7. What could I be wrong about?
Second-level thinking:
- "Everyone knows rates are going up" → but what if they don't?
- "This is a great business" → but at what price?
- "This worked before" → but is this time different?

### 8. How would I behave in a drawdown?
Psychological preparation:
- Which positions would I sell in panic?
- Which positions would I want to buy more of?
- Do I know enough about each holding to act rationally in stress?

## Application to Portfolio Analysis

When reviewing portfolio state:
1. **Identify structural vs. cyclical risks** in top holdings
2. **Flag positions priced for optimism** (high multiples, growth assumptions)
3. **Map cycle sensitivity** (defensive, neutral, cyclical)
4. **Note correlation clusters** (not just individual positions)
5. **Question the consensus** embedded in current prices

## What This Lens Does NOT Do

- Calculate intrinsic values (use valuation tools for that)
- Make market timing predictions
- Provide buy/sell recommendations
- Assign numeric risk scores

This lens surfaces **questions to think about**, not answers to act on.
