# Conservative Valuation Assumptions
# Used for test fixtures and as default profile

assumption_set_name: conservative

# Revenue Growth Assumptions
revenue_growth:
  short_term_rate: 0.07  # 7% for years 1-5
  long_term_rate: 0.03   # 3% terminal growth (GDP-like)
  short_term_years: 5
  rationale: "Conservative growth - below historical averages, sustainable long-term"

# Margin Assumptions (used if not provided in fundamentals)
margin_assumptions:
  default_operating_margin: 0.15  # 15% if unknown
  default_net_margin: 0.10        # 10% if unknown
  rationale: "Conservative margins - below industry averages"

# Discount Rate (Required Return)
discount_rate:
  total_rate: 0.12  # 12% required return
  components:
    risk_free_rate: 0.04          # 4% (10-year govt bonds)
    equity_risk_premium: 0.05     # 5% market risk premium
    company_specific_risk: 0.03   # 3% additional for individual stock risk
  rationale: "Conservative required return above market - accounts for individual stock risk"

# Margin of Safety
margin_of_safety:
  default_required: 0.25  # 25% MOS for general stocks
  high_quality: 0.20      # 20% MOS for exceptional businesses
  speculative: 0.40       # 40% MOS for higher-risk situations
  rationale: "Conservative margin - protects against valuation errors and unforeseen risks"

# Valuation Multiples (if using multiple-band method)
valuation_multiples:
  pe_ratio:
    low: 12
    base: 15
    high: 18
  price_to_fcf:
    low: 15
    base: 20
    high: 25
  rationale: "Conservative multiples - below long-term market averages"

# Asset Class Expected Returns (for ETFs/allocation)
asset_class_returns:
  equity_developed:
    expected_return: 0.08  # 8% nominal
    risk_premium: 0.04
  equity_emerging:
    expected_return: 0.10
    risk_premium: 0.06
  bonds_government:
    expected_return: 0.04
    risk_premium: 0.00
  commodities:
    expected_return: 0.03
    risk_premium: 0.02

# Position Sizing Rules
position_sizing:
  max_single_position: 0.15      # 15% max in one stock
  concentration_warning: 0.10    # Warn at 10%
  max_sector_exposure: 0.30      # 30% max in one sector

# Quality Thresholds
quality_criteria:
  min_roe: 0.15           # 15% return on equity
  min_roic: 0.12          # 12% return on invested capital
  max_debt_to_equity: 1.0 # 100% debt/equity ratio
  min_interest_coverage: 3.0  # 3x EBIT/Interest

# Notes
notes: |
  These assumptions represent a conservative baseline for valuation.
  
  Key principles:
  - Lower growth rates than historical averages
  - Higher discount rates (required returns)
  - Wider margin of safety requirements
  - Lower valuation multiples
  
  This profile is designed to:
  1. Avoid overpaying for investments
  2. Build in protection against errors
  3. Generate adequate returns with lower risk
  4. Focus on sustainable, durable businesses
  
  Adjust assumptions based on:
  - Business quality and competitive position
  - Industry dynamics and cyclicality
  - Management track record
  - Capital allocation discipline
  - Balance sheet strength
