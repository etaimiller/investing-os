# Revenue Growth Assumptions
# Conservative approach: prefer historical averages or lower
revenue_growth:
  methodology: |
    Use lower of: (1) historical 5-year average, (2) industry average, (3) GDP + inflation
    
  short_term_years: 5  # Project explicitly for 5 years
  short_term_rate: 0.07  # 7% default - should be customized per security
  
  long_term_rate: 0.03  # 3% terminal growth - typically GDP growth rate
  
  rationale: |
    Conservative growth rates prevent over-optimism. Short-term rates based on
    historical performance and industry context. Terminal rate assumes company
    grows at GDP rate in perpetuity - conservative for quality businesses.
    
  adjustment_factors:
    - High historical volatility: reduce rate by 20-30%
    - Cyclical business: use through-cycle average
    - New business/IPO: use industry average minus 2-3%
    - Mature business: use GDP growth rate
    
# Profitability Assumptions
margins:
  methodology: |
    Use lower of: (1) 5-year historical average, (2) demonstrated sustainable margins
    Assume mean reversion for margins above industry average
    
  operating_margin:
    default: null  # Must be set per security based on history
    approach: "Use trailing 5-year average or current if declining"
    
  net_margin:
    default: null  # Must be set per security based on history
    approach: "Conservative: use lower end of historical range"
    
  rationale: |
    Margins tend to mean-revert. High margins attract competition.
    Assume margins decline unless protected by moat.

# Discount Rate (Required Return)
discount_rate:
  methodology: |
    Build-up method: Risk-free rate + Equity risk premium + Company-specific risk
    Use higher discount rate for higher uncertainty
    
  components:
    risk_free_rate: 0.04  # 4% - use 10-year government bond yield
    equity_risk_premium: 0.05  # 5% - historical equity premium over bonds
    company_specific_risk: 0.03  # 3% - adjust based on business quality
    
  total_rate: 0.12  # 12% default minimum required return
  
  adjustments:
    wide_moat: -0.01  # Can reduce by 1% for wide moat businesses
    narrow_moat: 0.00  # No adjustment
    no_moat: +0.02  # Increase by 2% for commoditized businesses
    high_debt: +0.02  # Increase by 2% for overleveraged companies
    cyclical: +0.02  # Increase by 2% for cyclical businesses
    
  minimum_rate: 0.10  # Never use discount rate below 10%
  
  rationale: |
    Higher discount rate builds in conservatism. 12% minimum provides
    margin of safety. Adjust based on business quality and risks.

# Terminal Value Assumptions
terminal_value:
  preferred_method: perpetuity_growth
  
  perpetuity_growth:
    rate: 0.03  # 3% - long-term GDP growth
    rationale: "Conservative assumption that company grows at GDP rate forever"
    
  exit_multiple:
    # Alternative method - use only if perpetuity growth inappropriate
    pe_multiple: null  # Set based on industry and business quality
    approach: "Use lower end of historical industry average P/E"
    
  conservative_asset_value:
    # Most conservative - use for asset-heavy or declining businesses
    approach: "Use tangible book value as floor value"

# Margin of Safety
margin_of_safety:
  default_required: 0.25  # 25% - buy at 75% of intrinsic value or less
  
  adjustments:
    high_quality_business: 0.20  # Can reduce to 20% for high-quality businesses
    average_business: 0.25  # Standard 25%
    uncertain_business: 0.35  # Increase to 35% for higher uncertainty
    declining_business: 0.50  # Increase to 50% for turnarounds
    
  rationale: |
    Margin of safety protects against: (1) valuation errors, (2) unforeseen risks,
    (3) market volatility. Larger margin needed for lower-quality businesses.

# TODO: User Input Required
# - What is your minimum acceptable discount rate?
# - What margin of safety is required for different business quality levels?
# - How should growth rates be adjusted for different industries?
# - What sources will be used for financial data and assumptions?

# Relative Valuation Benchmarks
relative_valuation:
  pe_ratio:
    market_average: 18  # Update based on current market conditions
    high_quality_premium: 1.3  # Quality businesses can trade at 30% premium
    
  price_to_book:
    threshold_undervalued: 1.5  # Below 1.5x book may indicate undervaluation
    threshold_overvalued: 4.0  # Above 4.0x book requires exceptional ROIC
    
  approach: |
    Relative valuation is secondary to intrinsic value.
    Use as sanity check, not primary valuation method.

# Qualitative Assessment Factors

# Valuation Review Triggers
review_schedule:
  routine_review: quarterly  # Review all valuations quarterly

    - Price moves >20% from intrinsic value

# Conservative by Default Principles
principles:
  - When in doubt, use lower growth rates
  - When in doubt, use higher discount rates
  - When in doubt, require larger margin of safety
  - Never rely on aggressive assumptions
  - Prefer demonstrable history over projections
  - Quality of business over growth rate
  - Understand before valuing
  - Pass on opportunities you don't understand
